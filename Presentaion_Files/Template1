# Vision System for Pick Packer Robot

## Introduction

- Purpose: Enhance the functionality of a pick packer robot through a vision system.
- Design: Utilizes computer vision techniques to identify and locate objects of interest.
- Goals: Improve accuracy, efficiency, and autonomy of the pick and pack process.

---

## System Overview

- **Camera Integration**: Incorporates a camera to capture the robot's environment.
- **Color Filtering**: Detects specific objects based on predefined color ranges.
- **Object Localization**: Determines the position and size of target objects.
- **Distance Estimation**: Maps pixel counts to real-world distances using polynomial regression.

---

## Code Implementation

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import cv2
import numpy as np
import time

# Simulated data: Distance (in cm) and corresponding pixel counts
# ... (your code snippet)
# (Continues as per your provided code)
```
